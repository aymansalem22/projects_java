## Project I: Guess the Right Number

Rules of the game

The player has to guess a number between a specific range.

When the player guesses a wrong number, the other person gives hints
whether the guessed number is smaller or greater than the correct number.

To make it a bit challenging, the player will get limited attempts
to guess the number.

Overview of the project

We can create this game in a way that the computer will give you the number
 and range in which you have to guess. This project will focus on the use of 
iterations and conditional statements.

## Project II: Tic-Tac-Toe

Rules for Tic-tac-toe

   - Tic-tac-toe is played on a 3x3 grid.

   - There are only two players.

   - One player plays with “X”, and the other player plays with “O”. 
   They play in alternative turns and place an “X” or an “O” in empty positions.

   - The first player to get three of their characters in a row (horizontal), column (vertical), 
   or diagonal is the winner.

   - The game ends when one player wins, or nobody wins. The latter case means that the game ends in a tie.

Tic-tac-toe in Java

A complete Tic-tac-toe game can be easily created in Java. The core part of the code includes conditional statements,
iteration (loops), and 2D arrays. This project will also focus on method implementation in Java. We’ll make this game
together in this project. First, we’ll create and display the game board and then we’ll implement the logic of the game.
