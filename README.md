Project I: Guess the Right Number

Rules of the game

The player has to guess a number between a specific range.

When the player guesses a wrong number, the other person gives hints
whether the guessed number is smaller or greater than the correct number.

To make it a bit challenging, the player will get limited attempts
to guess the number.

Overview of the project

We can create this game in a way that the computer will give you the number
 and range in which you have to guess. This project will focus on the use of 
iterations and conditional statements.

In this project we will:

Generate a random number to be guessed
Implement the game logic


#Tasks: 

Task I: Generate the secret number

Task II: Implement the game logic

Task III: Level up the game




Task I: Generate the secret number

Our task is to generate a random number between 0 and 100 (inclusive). 
We’ve already created and initialized an int variable secret_number.
 We’ll update its value from 0 to the random number we’ll generate.

Task II: Implement the game logic

We’re provided the code for taking the player’s input, so now we 
just have to write the code to check whether the number provided 
by the player is correct or not. If the guess is right, the player wins.
 Otherwise, we’ll give them hints whether the guessed number is smaller 
or greater than the secret number.

Task III: Level up the game

Now, we want to challenge our players a bit, so we’ll give them only five 
chances to guess the secret number. Your task is to limit the number of times 
the user can guess the number. The rest of the conditions are the same.
